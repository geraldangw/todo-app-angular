TODO APP DONE DURING GA WDI4 UNIT 4 AS FINAL ASSIGNMENT.

DONE BY: GERALD ANG

DATABASE: MONGO
SERVER: EXPRESS
FRONT-END: ANGULAR
BACKEND: NODE.JS

This is a simple ToDo App that takes advantage of the functionality of a single page app that comes with a front end framework like Angular. It categorizes your tasks into a few key categories for easy reference and is time sensitive so your tasks for the day always appear at the top.

Also used Bootstrap framework for CSS.

Thanks for reading me!
